# uOrder
since the early repository was getting crowded and i was having trouble uploading to it

 - i think i have the receipt system working
 - adding items to order works
 - the auto closing message boxes had stopped working in the last clone from git and i couldn't find the problem so i had to back up to an earlier version

- I don't know if this what the readme is for but:
- Rachel's home+call button - I like the design! But do you think the users know what the bell icon represents? Too small for a tablet?
- Do we need a home button? I pushed a version with the logo leading to the start screen (but then you can't go in the menu afterwards...)
